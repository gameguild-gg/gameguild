## ✅ Authentication Headers Error - FIXED!

### 🐛 **Problem Identified:**
The "headers was called outside a request scope" error was occurring because the sign-in form was importing `signIn` from the wrong module:

**❌ Before (Incorrect):**
```typescript
import { signIn } from '@/auth';  // Server-side function requiring request context
```

**✅ After (Fixed):**
```typescript
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react';  // Client-side function for browser use
```

### 🔧 **Root Cause:**
In NextAuth v5, there are two different `signIn` functions:
1. **Server-side** (`@/auth`): Requires Next.js request context, used in server components/actions
2. **Client-side** (`next-auth/react`): Works in browser environment, used in client components

### 🎯 **Solution Applied:**
Updated `apps/web/src/components/auth/sign-in-form.tsx` to use the correct client-side import.

### 🧪 **Testing Status:**
- ✅ Import corrected in sign-in form
- ✅ No compilation errors remaining  
- ✅ Authentication callbacks updated to use direct fetch (no server actions)
- ✅ Google Sign-In should now work without headers error
- ✅ Admin login should work without headers error
- ✅ Token refresh should work without headers error

### 🚀 **Ready for Testing:**
The authentication system should now work properly:
1. **Google Sign-In** - Click the Google button without headers errors
2. **Session Persistence** - Maintains login across app restarts  
3. **Token Refresh** - Automatic token refresh in background
4. **Projects Dashboard** - Should load with proper authentication context

The modernized projects dashboard with the enhanced aesthetic is also ready and integrated!

# Portfolio Prototype Sharing and Feedback

## Part 1: Share Your Portfolio Prototype

1. Create a wireframe/mockup for your portfolio website. Include the layout and content structure to ensure clarity in
   your design.
2. Begin implementing your portfolio website using your chosen tools and technologies. Deliver the first draft of your
   site, ensuring you include placeholders for projects, sections, and other content.
3. Share the public v0.dev link or the published website for your portfolio prototype as a new post in this forum. Make
   sure to include a brief description of your design choices and the tools you used.

## Part 2: Provide Feedback

1. Review and leave constructive feedback on the portfolio prototypes of at least three other students.
2. Your feedback should address aspects like layout, usability, design consistency, and overall structure.
3. Be specific and polite in your comments. For example, instead of saying, “The layout is confusing,” try, “The
   navigation could be improved by adding labels to the menu items.”
4. Avoid leaving feedback on portfolios that already have three or more replies. This ensures everyone gets an equal
   opportunity to receive feedback.

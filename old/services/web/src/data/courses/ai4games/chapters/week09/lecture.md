# Introduction to Chess AI

Chess is one of the most popular board games in the world. It is a two-player strategy game that requires critical
thinking, foresight, and planning. The game has a rich history and has been played for centuries. Chess has also been a
popular subject for AI research, with many computer programs developed to play the game at a high level.

I choose chess as the subject for this course because it provides a rich environment for exploring AI techniques. Chess
is a complex game with a large branching factor, which makes it challenging for traditional search algorithms. Chess
also requires long-term planning and strategic thinking, which are essential skills for AI agents.

## 1. Chess Basics

### Board

The chessboard is an 8x8 grid with alternating light and dark squares. The rows are numbered from `1` to `8`, and the
columns are labeled from `A` to `H`. Each square on the board is identified by a unique coordinate, such as `E4` or
`G7`. The main diagonal color is always light as follows:

|   | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | 8 |
| 7 | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | 7 |
| 6 | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | 6 |
| 5 | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | 5 |
| 4 | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | 4 |
| 3 | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | 3 |
| 2 | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | 2 |
| 1 | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | ⬛ | ⬜ | 1 |
|   | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |   |

| 1 | ♖ | ♘ | ♗ | ♕ | ♔ | ♗ | ♘ | ♖ | 1 |
|   | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |   |

### Pieces

Chess has six different types of pieces:

- **Pawn** ♙️ / ♟:
  - **Moves forward one square** in the common **general case**;
  - Can **move two squares** on its **first move**;
  - **Captures** opponents **diagonally** in one square.
  - **Promotes** to any other piece when reaching the opposite side of the board.
  - Can perform an **en passant** capture.
- **Rook** ♖ / ♜:
  - **Moves horizontally** or **vertically** any number of squares.
  - **Castles** with the king under certain conditions.
- **Knight** ♘ / ♞:
  - **Moves in an L-shape**: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular.
  - Can **jump over other pieces**.
- **Bishop** ♗ / ♝:
  - **Moves diagonally** any number of squares.
  - Can only **stay on squares of the same color**.
- **Queen** ♕ / ♛:
  - **Moves horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally** any number of squares.
- **King** ♔ / ♚:
  - **Moves one square** in any direction.
  - Can **castle** with the rook under certain conditions.
  - Cannot move into check squares.

### Rules

**Capture**: No piece can move through another piece, but it can capture an opponent's piece by moving to its square.

**Check**: is a situation where the king is under threat of capture. The player must make a move to remove the check
such as blocking the attack, moving the king, or capturing the attacking piece.

**Checkmate**: the king is in check and cannot escape. The game ends, and the player who delivered the checkmate wins.

**En passant**: a special pawn capture that allows a pawn that has moved two squares forward from its starting position
to be captured by an opponent's pawn that is on an adjacent file and on the same rank.

**Stalemate**: the player has no legal moves, and their king is not in check. The game ends in a draw.

**50-move rule**: if no pawn has moved and no capture has been made in the last 50 moves, the game can be declared a
draw.

**Threefold repetition**: if the same position occurs three times with the same player to move, the game can be declared
a draw.

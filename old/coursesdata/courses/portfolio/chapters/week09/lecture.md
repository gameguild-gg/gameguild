## **Editing for Pacing, Transitions, and Clarity**

A great demo reel is **not just about content** but also how you **present it dynamically**.

### **Pacing**

- **Keep it snappy**‚Äîmost viewers lose interest after a few seconds.
- Follow a **crescendo structure**‚Äîstart with a strong highlight, maintain energy, and end on an impactful note.
- **Fast cuts for action, slower cuts for detail.**

### **Transitions**

- **Cut on motion** to make edits feel seamless.
- Use **crossfades and wipes sparingly**‚Äîhard cuts often work best.
- Match transitions to the **tempo of the background music**.

### **Clarity**

- **Avoid excessive effects**‚Äîkeep the focus on the content.
- Use **subtle text overlays** to describe what‚Äôs being shown.
- Ensure **readable fonts** (avoid small, cursive, or highly stylized text).

---

## **Adding Music & Voiceovers**

### **Music Selection**

- Use royalty-free or self-composed music.
- Match the **tone** to your project (e.g., upbeat for arcade games, atmospheric for horror).
- Keep **background music subtle**‚Äîavoid overpowering your visuals.

### **Voiceover Tips**

- Keep narration **short and to the point**.
- Maintain **consistent volume levels**‚Äîavoid sudden spikes.
- Speak **clearly and confidently**‚Äîpractice your script before recording.

## **The 3 Levels of Emotional Processing in a 30-Second Reel**

Inspired
by [Donald A. Norman‚Äôs Emotional Design Model](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/norman-s-three-levels-of-design),
your demo reel should engage at least one of these levels:

1. **Visceral Level (Instant Reaction)**
  - Make an **impact in the first 3 seconds of content** with an exciting moment or striking visual.
  - Ensure high-quality visuals and smooth animations.

2. **Behavioral Level (Practical Understanding)**
  - Show off **game mechanics, level design, or AI behavior** in a way that‚Äôs easy to grasp.
  - Use **before-and-after comparisons** or split-screen effects to highlight progress.

3. **Reflective Level (Deeper Meaning)**
  - End with a **memorable moment**‚Äîa great mechanic, a unique style, or a creative innovation.
  - Use a **tagline or logo** to reinforce your personal brand.

## **Tools for Editing & Enhancing Your Reel**

- [Color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) - for color theory and palette selection.
- [Contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) - to ensure text is readable against backgrounds.
- [Color blindness simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) - to check how your
  reel appears to colorblind viewers.

## **Detecting and Preventing Issues Before They Happen**

A polished demo reel isn't just about fixing mistakes after they occur, it is about anticipating problems before they
disrupt your presentation. Here are strategies to **detect and prevent issues early** in your editing process.

---

### **1. Use a Storyboard or Timeline Outline**

Before diving into editing, **plan out the flow** of your demo reel. A rough **storyboard or text-based timeline** helps
ensure:

- ‚úÖ A strong **opening hook** and impactful ending.
- ‚úÖ **Balanced pacing**‚Äînot too rushed or too slow.
- ‚úÖ Logical **progression of shots** to maintain clarity.

::: tip

Sketch out key moments or list timestamps with descriptions (e.g., *‚Äú00:03 - Character animation showcase‚Äù*).

:::

---

### **2. Check for Visual Clarity Early**

- üëÄ **Watch your reel without sound** to test if visuals alone communicate your message.
- üé≠ **Desaturate (black & white mode)** to check if contrast is strong enough.
- üìè **Pause at random frames**‚Äîeach shot should be **visually readable** without excessive clutter.
- üîç **Focus in on text** to ensure it‚Äôs legible at different sizes, add overlays, and backgrounds behind the texts to
  improve readability.
- üñåÔ∏è **Use color theory** to ensure your color palette is visually appealing and accessible, and test for color
  blindness.

---

### **3. Listen for Audio Issues**

- üîä **Play your reel at different volumes** to ensure no sound is overpowering.
- üéôÔ∏è **Check voiceovers** for clarity and balance‚Äîavoid music drowning out narration.
- üéµ **Test with and without sound** to ensure key moments aren‚Äôt entirely dependent on audio.

::: tip

If using music, ensure smooth fades and avoid abrupt cuts.

:::

---

### **4. Simulate Different Viewing Experiences**

Not everyone will watch your reel on the same screen. Test your reel in different scenarios:

- üì± **Phone screen test** ‚Äì Are small text and UI elements still readable?
- üíª **Different resolutions** ‚Äì Does your footage lose quality when resized?
- üåû **Brightness test** ‚Äì Watch it in a bright environment to check visibility.

---

### **5. Ask for Targeted Feedback Before Finalizing**

üöÄ **Before showing your reel, ask reviewers to focus on specific concerns**:

- *Does the pacing feel too fast or slow?*
- *Is any section confusing or unclear?*
- *Are transitions smooth or distracting?*
- *Does the color contrast make key elements stand out?*

::: tip

Include a short text with your submission asking peers to **focus on one or two areas** you‚Äôre unsure about.

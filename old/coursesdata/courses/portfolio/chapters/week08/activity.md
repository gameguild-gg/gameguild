## **In-Class Activity: Visualizing Complexity with UML Tools**

### **Objective**

In this activity, you will use one of the UML or diagramming tools to visually represent a **complex system, mechanic,
or workflow** from your game, project, or capstone. The goal is to illustrate an idea that **cannot be fully explained
through a screenshot or gameplay footage alone**.

### **Instructions**

1. **Choose a Concept**

- Identify a system, mechanic, or workflow in your project that is **difficult to communicate through images or videos
  alone**. Examples include:
  - AI decision-making process
  - Game state transitions
  - Multiplayer networking flow
  - Procedural generation pipeline
  - Skill tree or upgrade system

2. **Select a Diagram Type**

- Pick the best diagram format to represent your idea:
  - **State Machine Diagram** (for game state transitions)
  - **Flowchart** (for procedural generation logic)
  - **Sequence Diagram** (for player/enemy interactions or networking events)
  - **Class Diagram** (for illustrating code structure)

3. **Use a UML Tool**

- Select and use one of the following online tools to create your diagram:
  - [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/)
  - [Diagram.codes](https://diagram.codes/)
  - [Code2Flow](https://www.code2flow.com/)
  - [SequenceDiagram.org](https://sequencediagram.org/)
  - [Draw.io](https://www.diagrams.net/)

4. **Export & Share**

- Export your diagram as an image or share a link to your diagram.
- Post it in the class forum along with **a short explanation** of what it represents.

5. **Peer Review**

- Review at least **three classmates' diagrams**.
- Provide feedback on **clarity, accuracy, and potential improvements**.

### **Discussion & Reflection**

At the end of the activity, we will discuss:

- **What made the diagram effective or challenging to create?**
- **How do UML diagrams improve communication in game development?**
- **How would you refine your diagram for a professional setting?**

This exercise will **help you document and communicate complex game systems effectively**, which is a valuable skill for
both **development teams and portfolio presentations**.

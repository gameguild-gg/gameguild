# Game Guild Platform

Game Guild is a game dev community. We aim to revolutionize the way game developers collaborate, learn, and monetize their creations. Our platform will provide a space for developers to showcase their games, connect with other creators, and access resources for skill development. Users can discover new games, playtest them, and support their favorite developers through in-game purchases or donations.

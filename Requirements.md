- Courses can be categorized by topic, skill level, and language.

Course Publishing:

- Instructors can publish courses for free or set a price.
- Revenue share between the platform (DAO treasury) and the instructor, managed by smart contracts.

Course Management:

- Instructors can manage and update course content, respond to student queries, and track course performance.
- Learners can rate and review courses.

Certification:

- Automated issuance of certificates upon course completion, verified on the blockchain.

### 2.2 Course Purchase and Consumption

Course Marketplace:

- A searchable marketplace where learners can browse, filter, and purchase courses.
- Featured courses and recommendations based on user preferences and history.

Payment Processing:

- Integration with multiple payment gateways, including cryptocurrency options.
- Smart contracts to manage transactions, including course refunds and revenue distribution.

Course Player:

- A responsive and user-friendly interface for consuming course content.
- Bookmarking, note-taking, and progress tracking features.
- Gamification and tokenization of courses for engagement

### 2.3 Game Testing Functionality

Game Submission:

- Developers can submit games and different versions for testing.
- Support for various game formats (web-based, downloadable, mobile, etc.).

Feedback System:

- Players can test games and provide structured feedback (e.g., bug reports, gameplay suggestions).
- A rating system for game versions to help developers prioritize improvements.

Game Marketplace:

- A section of the platform where users can discover and playtest new games.
- Option for developers to monetize games through in-game purchases, ads, or premium versions.

### 2.4 Events

General Meetings:

- Meetings can be created by any logged-in user on the platform at any time.
- Users can submit any meetings including workshops, lectures, or other activities related to game development.
- The meetings are available for the community to view, attend, and participate in.

Choice Casts:

- The community votes on one event to become the "Choice Cast", a highlighted meeting in the calendar.
- The "Choice Cast" is chosen based on votes from the community using platform votes.
- These meetings are special, community-driven events that receive additional visibility and rewards.
- The chosen "Choice Cast" will be repeated according to the demand of the community and those present at previous meetings

Game Jams:

- Game Jams are time-limited events focused on collaborative game development, where participants work together or individually to create games based on a specific theme or challenge.
- Users can propose Game Jam events, which will follow the same submission and approval process as other events.
- Game Jams can be scheduled to run over a weekend, a week, or another defined period, depending on the event proposal.
- Participants in Game Jams may receive platform tokens or other rewards based on community votes or judging criteria defined by the event organizer.

Interaction with Events:

- Users can browse a rolling list of available events, including previously approved submissions.
- Platform tokens can be used to "buy" access or reserve spots in events submitted by any user.
- Historical events remain in the database, allowing users to reengage with past events if the creator reactivates or republishes them.

### 2.5 Content Creators

Blog Functionality:

- A dedicated blog where invited content creators can share articles, tutorials, and other relevant content.
- Only creators invited by the community or platform administrators can post on the blog.
- Blog posts serve as a hub for educational material and community discussions, fostering engagement and knowledge-sharing.

## 3. DAO Governance

DAO Structure:

- The platform will be governed by a DAO, where stakeholders (instructors, learners, developers, etc.) can participate in decision-making.
- Governance tokens will be issued to active participants, giving them voting rights on platform policies, feature development, and treasury management.

Proposals and Voting:

- Any user with governance tokens can propose new features, changes, or initiatives.
- Voting will be transparent and conducted on the blockchain, with smart contracts executing approved proposals.

Revenue Distribution:

- A portion of the platformâ€™s revenue will be directed to the DAO treasury.
- Community members can propose and vote on the allocation of these funds (e.g., marketing campaigns, platform development, grants for course creators).

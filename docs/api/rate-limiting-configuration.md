# Rate limiting configuration

The API uses ASP.NET Core's in-memory rate limiter. Enable it in the presentation layer and configure named policy limits under `RateLimiting`:

```json

  "PresentationLayer": {
    "EnableRateLimiting": true
  },
  "RateLimiting": {
    "RedisFailureMode": "FailOpen",

    },

      "DenylistedUserIds": [],
      "AllowlistedIpAddresses": [],
      "DenylistedIpAddresses": []
    }
  }
}
```

The application registers fixed-window policies for authentication, authorization and internal endpoints; sliding-window policies for API, tenant, user and IP limits; token-bucket policies for bursty and API-key traffic; and a concurrency policy for expensive operations. Additional policies under `RateLimiting:Policies` can define fixed-window, sliding-window or token-bucket limits and partition them by `Global`, `User`, `Ip`, `UserOrIp`, `Tenant` or `Endpoint`. Use the policy key with `[EnableRateLimiting("report-export")]`; endpoint partitions use the HTTP method and route template, without route parameter values. Redis mode applies these custom policies through the same shared limiter as built-in policies. Built-in policy names are reserved. API-key and user identities receive separate buckets: API-key requests use the authenticated key ID, never the submitted secret. Tenant partitions use the tenant resolver's validated context. IP partitions use `Connection.RemoteIpAddress`. `TrustedProxyAddresses` adds exact IPv4/IPv6 proxy addresses to ASP.NET Core's trusted proxy list and enables `X-Forwarded-For` processing before rate limiting. `TrustedProxyForwardLimit` controls how many trusted hops are consumed. The limiter never reads `X-Forwarded-For` or `X-Real-IP` directly, so an untrusted client cannot choose its own IP partition. Keep the list limited to proxies you operate and configure every proxy hop that is expected to forward client addresses.

`ExemptPaths` exempts matching paths and their descendants from the global limiter. A named endpoint policy still applies if an endpoint explicitly opts into one. Every configured count, period, queue size, sliding-window segment count and exempt path is validated during setup.

Rejected requests return HTTP 429 with Problem Details, `Retry-After`, `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining` and `RateLimit-Reset` headers. The rate-limit rejection handler writes a warning log with the request path and selected policy. The documented defaults preserve the prior per-IP limit of 30 requests per minute.

`RateLimiting:AccessControl` accepts exact user IDs and IP addresses. Denylisted identities receive HTTP 403 before endpoint execution; this takes priority if an identity appears in both lists. Allowlisted identities bypass the global and named rate-limit policies, including Redis-backed policies. IPv4-mapped IPv6 client addresses are normalized before matching. Forwarded addresses are considered only after trusted-proxy processing.

## Current scope and migration

This configuration extends the existing named in-process policies. Existing endpoints keep their `EnableRateLimiting` attributes; deployments can tune the values in `RateLimiting` without changing controller code. The older `RequestsPerMinute` and `BurstSize` members remain for configuration compatibility; use the policy-specific settings above for active limits.

The ASP.NET rate limiter remains process-local. When both `PresentationLayer:EnableRateLimiting` and `Redis:Enabled` are true, `RedisEndpointRateLimitingMiddleware` adds shared Redis gates after the local limiter: a fixed window for the global limit and the authentication, authorization and internal policies, a sliding window for API, tenant, user and IP policies, token buckets for bursty traffic and API keys, and renewable leases for expensive-operation concurrency. It uses the same validated identity, tenant and client-IP partitions as the local limiter. In Redis mode, ASP.NET's corresponding global, fixed/sliding, token-bucket, and expensive-operation concurrency policies are pass-through, avoiding duplicate process-local quotas. Configured exempt paths skip the global Redis gate while named endpoint policies still apply; `DisableRateLimiting` endpoints skip both gates.

Redis fixed-window, sliding-window, token-bucket, concurrency, and penalty decisions use atomic Lua scripts. Testcontainers integration tests send concurrent requests through four independent Redis connections and verify global and named-policy limits across separate middleware instances. A 200-request load test configures two TestServer API hosts through `SetupRateLimiting`, `UseRateLimiter`, and the Redis middleware, then verifies that exactly 20 permits are shared. A separate Testcontainers test starts two independent Kestrel OS processes and sends 200 concurrent requests through both; exactly the shared request limit is admitted. Bursty and API-key token buckets share capacity and refill state across instances. API-key buckets use the authenticated key ID and are isolated from user buckets; the current `ApiKey` record has no persisted tier, so the built-in API-key handler applies the standard limit. A premium limit is used only when a trusted authentication integration supplies the `api_key_tier=premium` claim. Expensive-operation permits are keyed by user, renewed while the request is active, released in a `finally` path, and reclaimed after `ConcurrencyLeaseDuration` if a process stops unexpectedly. Progressive penalties are opt-in (`EnableProgressivePenalties`, default `false`): after the configured number of rejections, each additional violation doubles the temporary block duration up to `PenaltyMaxDuration`; the violation count decays after `PenaltyDecayWindow`. Redis stores the violation window and active block atomically. Use Redis for cross-instance enforcement; the generic distributed-cache fallback does not provide atomic multi-node updates. Rejections emit the `gameguild.api.rate_limit.rejections` counter from meter `GameGuild.API.RateLimiting`, tagged only with policy and enforcement source to keep cardinality bounded. When `OpenTelemetry:Enabled` is true, the API registers this meter with the metrics provider; set `OpenTelemetry:OtlpEndpoint` to export it through OTLP, or enable `ConsoleExporterEnabled` for local inspection. The existing `/metrics` endpoint also exposes the Prometheus counter `gameguild_api_rate_limit_rejections_total` with policy and enforcement labels. `deploy/monitoring/prometheus/gameguild-rate-limiting.rules.yml` provides recording, warning and critical rules for sustained and severe rejection rates. Add the file to Prometheus `rule_files`, scrape the API `/metrics` endpoint, and tune the example thresholds against service traffic before paging. Redis failures use `RateLimiting:RedisFailureMode`. `FailOpen` is the default and preserves availability during Redis outages. `FailClosed` rejects requests whose admission cannot be checked with HTTP 503 Problem Details (`errorCode=rate_limit_store_unavailable`); request cancellation still propagates. Choose the deployment value based on the service's availability and abuse-risk requirements. The paired BenchmarkDotNet MediumRun currently measures 10.07 us and 7.51 KB without the limiter versus 12.10 us and 8.84 KB with the in-memory global limiter; overlapping 99.9% intervals, short measured iterations, and outliers make it diagnostic only. See docs/plans/issue-closeout/issue-149-rate-limit-performance.md for the run details. Focused unit and Testcontainers coverage is present; Docker is unavailable on the local host, so the Redis tests have only been compiled here. Representative production profiling and operator selection of the Redis failure mode remain open. Keep issue 149 open until those requirements are addressed.

These represent actual security risks if deployed to production.

| # | File | Line | TODO Text | Risk |
|---|------|------|-----------|------|
| 1 | [EncryptionService.cs](../apps/api/Source/Modules/GameGuild.Identity.Authentication/Services/EncryptionService.cs#L13) | 13 | ~~Encryption key (TODO: Move to secure key vault/configuration)~~ | ✅ Key is loaded from `Encryption:Key`; fallback logs an explicit production warning |

| 6 | [Web3Service.cs](../apps/api/Source/Modules/GameGuild.Identity.Authentication/Services/Web3Service.cs#L11) | 11 | ~~TODO: In production, use Redis or distributed cache instead of in-memory dictionary~~ | ✅ `IDistributedCache` challenge storage is used when registered, with memory fallback |
| 7 | [Web3Service.cs](../apps/api/Source/Modules/GameGuild.Identity.Authentication/Services/Web3Service.cs#L27) | 27 | ~~TODO: In production, use Redis with expiration~~ | ✅ Challenge and wallet nonce entries use absolute expiration in memory and distributed cache |
| 8 | [EmailVerificationService.cs](../apps/api/Source/Modules/GameGuild.Identity.Authentication/Services/EmailVerificationService.cs#L13) | 13 | ~~TODO: Replace with actual database or distributed cache (Redis) for production~~ | ✅ Verification/reset/magic-link tokens use `IDistributedCache` when registered, with memory fallback |

> create/update/delete logic. CreateFeature uses `_repository.AddAsync()`. Enable/Disable/Toggle
> use fetch→mutate→`UpdateAsync` pattern. Update applies selective null-coalescing property updates.
> FeatureFlagQueryRepository: 5 methods implemented (UsageSummary, Statistics, EvaluationHistory,
> Dependency tracking, Analytics), with dependency persistence backed by `feature_flag_dependencies`.
> FeatureFlagsController.GetEnabled endpoint wired to `evaluationService.GetEnabledFeaturesAsync()`.

## Architecture

### Module Registration

```csharp
// In Program.cs or module configuration
services.AddAuditModule();
```

### Controllers

- `AuditController` - Standard audit log queries and statistics
- `SecurityAuditController` - Advanced security analytics and anomaly detection

### Database Context

Audit entities are registered in the `ApplicationDbContext` with:
- Soft delete filters
- Multi-tenancy support
- Optimistic concurrency control

## Usage Examples

### Basic Audit Logging

```csharp
await _auditService.LogAsync(new CreateAuditLogRequest
{
    ActionType = AuditActionTypes.UserCreated,
    ResourceType = "User",
    ResourceId = userId.ToString(),
    UserId = actorId,
    TenantId = tenantId,
    Description = "New user account created",
    Success = true,
    RiskLevel = AuditRiskLevel.Medium,
    Category = AuditCategory.Authentication
});
```

### Permission Auditing

```csharp
// On permission grant
await _auditService.LogPermissionGrantAsync(
    userId, 
    "admin:manage_users", 
    "Tenant", 
    tenantId.ToString()
);

// On permission denial
await _auditService.LogPermissionDenyAsync(
    userId, 
    "admin:delete_tenant", 
    "Tenant", 
    tenantId.ToString(), 
    "User lacks admin role"
);
```

### Tamper-Evident Logging

```csharp
var log = TamperEvidentAuditLog.Create(
    tenantId,
    userId,
    "UpdateUserProfile",
    "User",
    userId,
    beforeSnapshot,
    afterSnapshot,
    changes,
    "High",
    ipAddress,
    userAgent,
    country,
    region,
    city,
    previousHash,
    sequenceNumber
);

log.SetCryptographicHashes(contentHash, chainHash);
log.Sign(digitalSignature, signingKeyId);
```

### Compliance Package Creation

```csharp
var package = ComplianceEvidencePackage.Create(
    tenantId,
    "Q4 2025 SOC2 Audit",
    ComplianceFramework.SOC2,
    "1.0",
    startDate,
    endDate,
    preparedBy: "audit@company.com"
);

package.SetPackageContents(
    auditLogs: 15000,
    anomalies: 12,
    accessLogs: 50000,
    sizeBytes: packageSize
);

package.Sign(packageHash, digitalSignature);
package.MarkAsReviewed(reviewedBy: "security@company.com");
package.Approve(approvedBy: "ciso@company.com");
```

## Integration Points

### Identity Modules

The audit module integrates with:
- `GameGuild.Identity.Authentication` - Authentication event logging
- `GameGuild.Identity.Authorization` - Permission and policy audit trails
- `GameGuild.Identity.Users` - User lifecycle events

### Other Compliance Modules

Works alongside:
- `GameGuild.Compliance.KYC` - Identity verification auditing
- `GameGuild.Compliance.FERPA` - Educational privacy compliance

## Security Considerations

1. **Audit Log Integrity**: Use tamper-evident logs for critical security events
2. **PII Protection**: Enable field-level masking for sensitive data
3. **Retention Policies**: Configure appropriate retention based on regulatory requirements
4. **Access Control**: Restrict audit log access to authorized security personnel
5. **Encryption**: Enable encryption for audit exports and evidence packages
6. **SIEM Integration**: Forward critical events to SIEM for real-time monitoring

# Testing Lab Component Library

Consolidated summary.

## Achievements

- Modular reusable components
- SSR-optimized separation (server vs client)
- Central filter context
- Generic display primitives

## Architecture

```text
components/common/filters/*  (context, reducer, registration)
components/common/display/*  (Table, Card, Row)
```

## Patterns

- `useReducer` deterministic state transitions
- O(n) filtering / O(log n) sorting
- Generic prop typing for safety

# Tokenomics

The Tokenomics of the Game Guild will follow a hybrid DAO model where the distribution of the voting power will be based on the amount of GGG tokens held by each member, except for the discretionary positions such as: C-Level and Board of Directors. They will hold a fixed amount of voting power in total, initially the distribution will be as follows:

- 10% for the Board of Directors
- 10% for the C-Level
- 80% for the community

It will be hybrid because some actions will be executed off-chain and some on-chain. The off-chain executions will be overseen by the C-Level, Board of Directors, and the community.

## Discretionary Tokens

The discretionary tokens (Board of Directors and C-Level) will start as 20% of the total supply and cannot be diluted. Which means that even if the community decides to mint more tokens, more discretionary tokens will be minted and distributed to the discretionary positions.

The percentage "20%" can be changed by the community later and can be seen as a way to protect the community from malicious actors, or from the lack of performance of the C-Level or Board of Directors. The community will be able to remove them from their positions if they are not aligned with the community values, principles, and goals.

The owners of the discretionary tokens won't be able to transfer or sell their tokens. They will only be able to vote with them, or delegate their voting power, or follow the majority of the community (default option).

Every time a C-Level election is held, the ownership of the discretionary tokens will changed based on the results of the election, all discretionary tokens from the previous C-Level will be burned and new tokens will be minted and distributed to the new and elected C-Levels.

A C-Level can be removed from the position by the community if a proposal is posted on Tally and approved by the majority of the community, and it will trigger a new election. The same will happen with the Board of Directors. The main reason for the removal of a C-Level or Board of Directors will be the lack of performance, alignment with the community values, principles, and goals, or any other reason that the community decides.

If the holder of a discretionary token is no longer part of the Game Guild or banned, the token will be burned and the voting power will be lost temporarily until the next election in case of C-Level. But in case of a Board of Directors, the tokens will be burned and the community will elect a new member to hold the tokens.

## Community Tokens

The community tokens will work as a normal ERC20 token, they will be able to be transferred, sold, or used as collateral in DeFi platforms.

## Reflection

The token implements a reflection mechanism, a fee is charged on every transaction it is redistributed to existing token holders. This rewards holders directly by increasing their token balance automatically, promoting long-term holding and reducing sell pressure.

## Proposals and Voting

Any member of the community will be able to propose new features, changes, or initiatives. The proposals will be posted on Tally and the community will be able to vote on them. The proposals will be executed by smart contracts if they are approved.

## Fundraising Minting

In case of money raise, the platform will accept investments in exchange for GGG tokens at the current price on the DEX. Effectively it won't cause price inflation, but it will dilute the voting power of the current holders. The dilution will be proportional to the amount of tokens minted and sold. If a person is willing to maintain their voting power, they will have to buy more tokens.

## Fees

The platform will charge a fee for every transaction made on the platform and on DEX. The fee will help to maintain the platform and pay for the development of new features. The community will decide the destination of the fees, the proposals will be posted on Tally, but initially 50% will be destined to the treasury and 50% will be destined to the development of new features. 

## Staking

If your wallet holds more than X amount of GGG tokens or Y amount of USD worth in GGG tokens, you will receive Z benefits. The benefits will be decided by the community and the proposals will be posted on Tally.

Tiers:
 
- If your wallet holds more than 100USD worth in GGG tokens(checked on the DEX), you will receive free access to all basic courses;
- If your wallet holds more than 1000USD worth in GGG tokens(checked on the DEX), you will receive access to a private channel on Discord with the C-Level and Board of Directors;

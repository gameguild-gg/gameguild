## Overview

## Revenue Distribution

In case of dividends distribution, the revenue will be distributed based on the amount of GGG tokens held by each member
including discretionary tokens. The revenue will be distributed in the form of GGG tokens, so DEXs or CEXs will be used
to convert the tokens or fiat from the current revenue to GGG tokens.

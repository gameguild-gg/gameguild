# Overview

The proposed functionality would allow users to establish "Chapters" within the platform, providing tools for organizing events, sharing resources, and fostering engagement within specific locations or interest groups.

## 1. Purpose of a GameGuild Chapter

A GameGuild Chapter is a localized or thematic community that aims to:

- Foster collaboration among game developers.
- Promote knowledge sharing through workshops, events, and resources.
- Expand GameGuild's presence and influence in diverse regions or areas of interest.

## 2. Key Features

### Chapter Creation

- A dedicated form to create chapters, including fields for the chapter name, description, location, and area of focus.
- Custom branding options, such as uploading a logo and banner image.

### Membership Management

- Support for roles such as chapter leaders, moderators, and general members.
- Optional member approval system for private or invite-only chapters.

### Event Planning
- Tools to schedule, manage, and promote events within the chapter.
- Integration with the platform’s existing event system for tracking and attendance.

### Communication Tools

- A dedicated communication space (e.g., forum or chat) for each chapter.
- Notification features for announcements, updates, and upcoming events.

## 3. Benefits

Creating a GameGuild Chapter offers numerous advantages both to the community and the broader platform. Chapters serve as hubs for localized or interest-based networking, enabling members to build stronger connections within their specific areas or niches.

- Strengthens connections within the community by facilitating localized or interest-based networking.
- Enhances the platform’s value by providing an avenue for members to engage and collaborate meaningfully.
- Promotes diverse content and initiatives aligned with the needs of different regions or groups.
- Enables the hosting of impactful events like meetups, hackathons, game jams, and panel discussions.
- Showcases the talent and innovation within specific regions or focus groups, contributing to the game development community.
- Acts as an incubator for collaborative projects, such as games, tools, or educational resources.

## 4. Prerequisites for Starting a Chapter

To create a Chapter, the following requirements must be met:

- **Membership**: Minimum of 10 initial members interested in joining the Chapter.
- **Leadership**: At least one dedicated Chapter Leader responsible for management.
- **Vision**: A clear statement of purpose and objectives for the Chapter.
- **Location/Focus**: Defined geographic location or area of focus (e.g., "Game Developers in Los Angeles" or "VR Game Design Enthusiasts").

## 5. Chapter Management Tools

GameGuild provides the following tools to help Chapters operate efficiently:

### Membership Management

- Role assignments (Leader, Moderator, Member).
- Member approval for private or invite-only Chapters.

### Event Management

- Create and manage events (workshops, meetups, etc.).
- Track attendance and collect feedback.

### Communication Tools

- Dedicated forum or chat for each Chapter.
- Notifications for announcements and updates.


## 6. Responsabilities of Chapter Leaders

Chapter Leaders are expected to:

- Maintain regular communication with members and the GameGuild team.
- Organize a minimum of one event per quarter.
- Submit a quarterly report summarizing activities, metrics, and challenges.
- Uphold the values and reputation of GameGuild in all Chapter activities.

To ensure the use of the GameGuild name benefits both the platform and the community, the following metrics can serve as measurable indicators of the Chapter's activity and contributions:

- **Active Members**: Number of unique members participating in events, discussions, or activities within a specific time frame.
- **Event Frequency**: Number of events (workshops, talks, meetups) organized per month or quarter.
- **Post-Event Feedback**: Percentage of attendees providing positive feedback or ratings (e.g., 4+ out of 5).
- **Shared Resources**: Number of guides, tutorials, or tools created and shared by the Chapter.
- **Games Developed**: Number of game projects started or completed within the Chapter, showcasing the GameGuild name.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Percentage of revenue from Chapter-organized paid events, workshops, or sponsorships contributed to GameGuild.
- **Donation Campaigns**: Funds raised for GameGuild through Chapter-hosted donation drives or events.
- **Media Coverage**: Mentions of the Chapter and GameGuild in local or niche publications, podcasts, or streams.

These are some suggested metrics to track Chapter growth over time while ensuring that GameGuild receives tangible benefits in exchange for granting the use of its name.

## 7. Branding and Licensing Guidelines

To ensure consistent representation of GameGuild, Chapters must adhere to these guidelines:

- Use the official GameGuild logo and branding materials provided.
- Include the phrase “A Chapter of GameGuild” in all promotional materials.
- Obtain approval from the GameGuild team for major initiatives or partnerships.

## 8. Revocation of Chapter Status

Chapters may lose their status if they:

- Fail to meet activity requirements for two consecutive quarters.
- Engage in actions that harm GameGuild’s reputation.
- Violate branding or licensing guidelines.

Revoked Chapters will lose access to the Chapter Management Dashboard and must reapply if they wish to reinstate their status.

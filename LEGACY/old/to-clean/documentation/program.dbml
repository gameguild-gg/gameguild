// Performance Considerations for High-Volume Tables:
// 1. financial_transactions: Time-based partitioning recommended when exceeding 1M rows
// 2. content_interactions: Consider table partitioning by program_id for large programs
// 3. user_certificates: Add covering indexes for verification queries
// 4. For all timestamp-based queries: Create partial indexes limited to relevant date ranges
// 5. Consider hash indexes for exact match lookups on high-cardinality columns
//
// Index Recommendations for High Frequency Operations:
// - Add covering indexes that include commonly selected columns
// - Use partial indexes to reduce index size and improve maintenance
// - Consider BRIN indexes instead of B-tree for timestamp columns with natural ordering
// - Monitor and adjust index strategy based on query performance data

// Database Constraints:
// 1. CASCADE DELETE: When a user is soft-deleted, related records remain but are inaccessible through API
// 2. CASCADE DELETE: When a program is soft-deleted, all related content (pages, activities) remain but are inaccessible
// 3. RESTRICT DELETE: Products with active purchases cannot be deleted until all user_products are expired
// 4. ON DELETE CASCADE: For junction tables to maintain referential integrity
// 5. CHECK CONSTRAINTS: All percentage fields are validated to be between 0-100
// 6. CHECK CONSTRAINTS: All price fields must be non-negative

// Critical Business Rules as Database Constraints:
// 1. CHECK (minimum_grade BETWEEN 0 AND 100): Certificate minimum_grade must be 0-100%
// 2. CHECK (completion_percentage BETWEEN 0 AND 100): Program completion percentage must be 0-100%
// 3. CHECK (base_price >= 0): Product pricing must be non-negative
// 4. CHECK (referral_commission_percentage BETWEEN 0 AND 100): Commission rates must be valid percentages
// 5. CHECK (affiliate_percentage <= 100): Affiliate share cannot exceed 100%
// 6. CHECK (grade BETWEEN 0 AND 100): Activity grades must be 0-100%
// 7. CHECK (current_period_end > current_period_start): Subscription periods must have valid date ranges

// CASCADE Behavior Details:
// - user_certificates: When a user is deleted, certificates remain but are not accessible
// - program_users: When a program is deleted, enrollment records remain but are inactive
// - content_interactions: When content is deleted, user interactions are preserved for records
// - financial_transactions: Transactions are never hard-deleted for audit purposes
// - user_products: When a product is soft-deleted, existing purchases remain valid until expiration
// - user_subscriptions: When a subscription plan is deleted, active subscriptions continue until their next renewal

// todo: jsonb validation.
// Add constraint to enforce expected schema
//  constraint check_body_schema CHECK (jsonb_typeof(body) = 'object' AND body ? 'content')
// Add audit logging for sensitive operations
// add double-entry accounting for financial transactions

// Table Partitioning Strategy:
// For high-volume tables like financial_transactions, employ time-based partitioning by month
// using PostgreSQL declarative partitioning. Example implementation:
//
// CREATE TABLE financial_transactions (
//   ... column definitions ...
// ) PARTITION BY RANGE (created_at);
//
// CREATE TABLE financial_transactions_y2025m1 PARTITION OF financial_transactions
//   FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');
//
// CREATE TABLE financial_transactions_y2025m2 PARTITION OF financial_transactions
//   FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-02-01') TO ('2025-03-01');
//
// This approach provides:
// 1. Improved query performance for date-range queries
// 2. Easier archiving of older data
// 3. More efficient maintenance operations like vacuum
// 4. Better index management

// PostgreSQL Table Inheritance Alternative:
// Instead of partitioning, consider PostgreSQL's table inheritance for specialized transaction types:
//
// CREATE TABLE financial_transactions (
//   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
//   amount DECIMAL NOT NULL,
//   ...shared columns...
// );
//
// CREATE TABLE purchase_transactions (
//   product_id INT REFERENCES products(id),
//   ...purchase-specific columns...
// ) INHERITS (financial_transactions);
//
// CREATE TABLE withdrawal_transactions (
//   withdrawal_method VARCHAR,
//   ...withdrawal-specific columns...
// ) INHERITS (financial_transactions);
//
// Benefits:
// 1. Natural organization of transaction-specific fields
// 2. Queries against parent table include all child records
// 3. Easier to maintain different indexes for different transaction types
// 4. Simplified application logic with specialized transaction tables


// Wallet/Balance Management System
// The current design uses fields in the users table (balance, available_balance) for wallet management.
// For improved scalability when transaction volume increases, consider these enhancements:
//
// 1. Separate wallet table: Create a dedicated wallet table with one-to-many relationship with users
//    to support multiple currency/token types and better auditability
//
// 2. Implement double-entry accounting: Each balance change recorded with two offsetting entries
//    (debit and credit) in a separate balance_ledger table
//
// 3. Performance optimizations:
//    - Add materialized views for financial reporting
//    - Create summary tables for high-frequency aggregate queries
//    - Consider time-based partitioning for transaction-related tables
//
// 4. Additional indexing:
//    - Composite indexes for common reporting queries
//    - Include covering indexes for high-frequency lookups
//
// When transaction volume exceeds 100K daily, implement these changes to maintain system performance.

//------------------------------------------------------
// CERTIFICATE ISSUANCE BUSINESS LOGIC
//------------------------------------------------------

// Certificate Issuance Requirements:
// 1. User must complete all required program content (based on completion_percentage)
// 2. User must achieve minimum_grade if specified
// 3. If requires_feedback = true: User must submit feedback using program_feedback_submissions
// 4. If requires_rating = true: User must submit rating using program_ratings
// 5. If minimum_rating is set: User's rating must meet or exceed this threshold
// 6. All requirements must be met before certificate can be issued

// Example Certificate Issuance Check Query:
// SELECT
//   c.id as certificate_id,
//   c.name as certificate_name,
//   CASE
//     WHEN c.requires_feedback AND cfs.id IS NULL THEN 'Missing feedback submission'
//     WHEN c.requires_rating AND cr.id IS NULL THEN 'Missing rating submission'
//     WHEN c.minimum_rating IS NOT NULL AND (cr.rating IS NULL OR cr.rating < c.minimum_rating) THEN 'Rating below minimum threshold'
//     WHEN pu.completion_percentage < c.completion_percentage THEN 'Program not completed'
//     WHEN c.minimum_grade IS NOT NULL AND pu.final_grade < c.minimum_grade THEN 'Grade below minimum'
//     ELSE 'Ready for certificate issuance'
//   END as issuance_status
// FROM certificates c
// JOIN program_users pu ON pu.program_id = c.program_id
// LEFT JOIN program_feedback_submissions cfs ON cfs.user_id = pu.user_id AND cfs.program_id = c.program_id
// LEFT JOIN program_ratings cr ON cr.user_id = pu.user_id AND cr.program_id = c.program_id
// WHERE pu.user_id = ? AND c.program_id = ? AND c.is_active = true;

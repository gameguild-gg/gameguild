  - Include your plan for finishing the project.

2. **Provide a Testable Build**

    and instructions.

  - Briefly describe your progress and challenges in your post.

### **Peer Review Instructions**
- 

- Review and provide feedback on **at least five classmates' projects**.
- **Prioritize students with fewer responses** to ensure everyone gets feedback.
- Focus your feedback on:
  - The **scope** of the project and how much has been completed.
  - What has changed and improved since the beginning.
  - If a testable build is available, **playtest it** and provide insights on functionality, clarity, and user
    experience.
  - Offer **constructive suggestions** for their next steps.

### **Deadline**

- Ensure you submit your project and complete your peer reviews by the assigned deadline.
- Late submissions may not receive feedback from peers. But you still have to provide feedback to your peers.

By participating in this peer review, you’ll gain **valuable insights into different development approaches**, help your
classmates refine their projects, and receive feedback that could strengthen your own work before the final submission.

# Academic Honesty Policy

This document outlines the rules and processes for submissions, including grading policies, deadlines, tolerances, and AI-assistant tool usage guidelines.

## Policy on Limited use of AI-assisted tools

::: note

"During classes, AI writing tools such as **Claude**, **ChatGPT**, and others may be used in certain specific cases. Students will be informed as to when, where, and how these tools are permitted to be used, along with guidance for attribution. Any use outside of these specific cases constitutes a violation of Academic Honesty Policy." [Source](https://clt.champlain.edu/kb/communicating-your-chatgpt-ai-policies/).

:::

The learner has to produce original content. You can use tools like `LLMs` to help you learn by prompting your own questions, but not to solve the problems, assignments, or quizzes. So you will have to prompt engineer questions properly by always stating to not give you the full answer, but to help you understand the concepts and ideas. The rationale is that **the student has to learn the concepts and ideas rather than just copying and pasting the answers**.

### What is acceptable:

- On writing, coding assignments, or interactive assignments, you can ask AI questions about concepts, ideas, syntaxes, etc. Every time you prompt it something, **always state that you are not asking for the full answer, but to help you understand and use dialetic process to help you**.
- You can ask AI assistants what is wrong with your code, but you cannot use the answer 1 to 1 copy to your final submission. You have to modify it. A nice way to do that is read, understand, go do something else, than come back and try to do by yourself.
- In extreme conditions, if a submission **contains** part of an AI-assisted tool, it must be cited. Ex.: `The following was prompted in ChatGPT: ___, and the answer was ___.` Points will be deducted from submissions with fairness instead of receiving zero points;

### What is not acceptable

- AI autocompletion cannot be used to write code; use JetBrains tools instead, without AI agent enabled.
- You cannot copy the question and prompt AI to answer it and then use the answer as your own;
- You cannot ask AI to code a solution for you;
- AI assistance while coding (e.g. GitHub Copilot) is not permitted; using any standard IDE is recommended instead;
- You cannot use AI assistance to solve quizzes or exams in any circumstances.
- Even in accepted cases, using AI assistance and not citing it will be considered plagiarism and will be reported to higher instances and zero-ed;

### How Plagiarism and AI-assisted Tool Abuse is Detected

- Automated tools such as Turnitin (Canvas), MOSS (Beecrowd), and others are used;
- Professional experience is applied to detect plagiarism;
- When students use the same AI assistant, they often produce identical answers, which can be easily detected;

## Grading Timelines

Assignments are typically graded within 1 week, with efforts made to grade them as soon as possible. The maximum grading time is two weeks.

## Late Submissions Policy

If you submit an assignment late, you will receive a 1% deduction per day on your grade, up to a maximum of 30% deduction, in other words, the worst scenario would be to gave a C grade if you do everything correct but late.

Students with accommodations should send a message with each submission stating this requirement. While Canvas is a useful tool, it could better support accommodations.

Students experiencing special conditions, such as illness, death of a relative, or any other circumstances preventing timely submission, should send a message through Canvas for potential accommodation.

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism is a serious offense and will be reported to higher authorities. Plagiarism is defined as:

- Searching for answers on the internet and copy and paste it as your own;
- Copying answers from other students;
- Using AI-assisted tools to produce full answers;
- Using AI-assisted tools to produce partial answers without citing it;

## Learning Environment

This course aims to provide the best possible teaching and guidance throughout the learning process. Students can expect both friendly support and professional instruction, with accommodations made for those who need them.

## Most Excited Topics:

- **Pathfinding algorithms** 
- **Procedural content generation**
- **Enemy AI behavior and decision making**
- **Agent movement mechanics**
- **Turn-based AI systems**
- **NPC behavior and dialogue systems**
- **Content generation and noise algorithms**

## Key Student Quotes:
- "I really want to dive deeper into the depths of AI for games".
- "I'm super excited for this class -- adding elements to my games to make them more interactive and reactive".
- "I'm especially interested in procedural terrain generation (Minecraft, for example)".
- "I am excited to see more about what people consider to be 'intelligence'"

## 2. Ideal Class Structure Preferences

### Assignment Structure:
- **Hands-on learning preferred** - practical implementation
- **Gradual building approach** - increase complexity over time
- **Project-based learning** - with portfolio pieces
- **Creative freedom** - in assignment solutions
- **Isolated features** - that can be applied to other projects

### Workload Expectations:
- **Comfortable with heavier workload** for a third-year class
- Preference for **meaningful work over repetitive tasks**
- **2-3 hours per week outside class** considered reasonable
- Want assignments that **build on previous learning**

### Teaching Approach Preferences:
- **Learn → Demonstrate → Apply** structure
- **In-class hands-on work** with peer collaboration
- **Social learning environment** with professor and peer interaction
- **Clear explanations** from simple to complex levels

### Some Quotes:
- "I like hands on work, so projects or mini demos would be great"
- "I think very hands on learning in class can help us succeed"
- "I want most of the effort to be in understanding and creating fundamental pieces"
- "I think a good AI class is one where you are not just lectured about a topic, but working with what you are learning"

## 3. C++ Confidence Levels

### High Confidence (Very Confident):
- Some reports more than 7+ years, one reported having experience since age 9. Amazing!
- Students with C# background find transition easier.

### Moderate Confidence (Pretty/Fairly Confident):
- **Majority of students** fall into this category
- Common sentiment: "Confident with basics, may need review on specifics"
- Many haven't used C++ recently but feel they can pick it up quickly

### Lower Confidence (Need Support):
- 3 students reported low confidence in C++.
- Several students mention **pointers as challenging**
- Most express willingness to ask for help when needed

### Key Insights:
- Students with **C# background** feel more confident due to similarity
- **Documentation dependency** is common even among confident students
- **Willingness to learn** is high across all confidence levels

## 4. Game AI Definitions

### Common Themes:
- **NPC/Enemy behavior and decision making**
- **Pathfinding and navigation**
- **Non-player controlled elements**
- **Adaptive systems that respond to player actions**
- **Procedural content generation**

### Thoughtful Definitions:
- "Game AI is when you use a system which doesn't always make the same 'decision' and can introduce variety"
- "Anything that takes in the game state and does an action based on what the game state is"
- "Content in games that is generated on a per player basis, rather than being pre made"
- "Creating human-like experiences for players"
- "Algorithms that inform weighted decisions"

## 5. AI Assistant Tools - Student Perspectives

### Cautious/Limited Use Advocates:
- **Majority position**: Useful as tools but shouldn't replace learning
- Common approach: Use for **debugging, concept explanation, autocomplete**
- Concern about **inhibiting personal learning and skill development**

### Specific Use Cases Students Support:
- **Debugging assistance** when stuck
- **Concept explanation** in different ways
- **Code organization help**
- **Autocomplete for routine code**
- **Research efficiency** (faster than manual searching)

### Strong Concerns Expressed:
- "Relying on AI tools really inhibits your own learning"
- "Most people use them wrong, bringing negative impact on their skillset"
- "I'd rather put in the effort to improve my problem solving skills"
- "They defeat the point of paying to learn something"

### Balanced Perspectives:
- "Treat it like a personal tutor; not there to do work for me, but to teach and help when stuck"
- "Should not be used to directly solve assignments but help speed up learning"
- "Can be helpful when trying to do something above your current level"

## 6. Schedule Feedback

### Overall Satisfaction:
- **Overwhelming majority** satisfied with current schedule
- Students appreciate the **structured weekly plan**
- **No major changes requested** by most students

### Specific Requests:
- **Canvas reminders** with correct due dates
- **Grading/late policy** clarification
- One student noted **duplicate syllabus quizzes**

## 7. Notable Individual Insights

### Philosophical Perspectives:
- Arija Hartel questions what constitutes "intelligence" in AI systems
- Several students distinguish between "true AI" and algorithmic decision-making
- Interest in **ethical considerations** of AI in games

### Technical Interests:
- Strong interest in **behind-the-scenes mechanics**
- Desire to understand **internal workings** rather than just using existing solutions
- Enthusiasm for **optimization and complex systems**

### Learning Preferences:
- High value on **peer collaboration**
- Preference for **understanding fundamentals** before advanced applications
- Interest in **portfolio-worthy projects**

## 8. Key Recommendations Based on Feedback

### Maintain Current Strengths:
- **Project-based approach** is well-received
- **Hands-on learning** emphasis aligns with student preferences
- **Gradual complexity building** matches expectations

### Consider Enhancements:
- Ensure **Canvas organization** with clear due dates
- Provide **C++ refresher resources** for rusty students
- Emphasize **collaborative learning opportunities**
- Include discussions on **AI ethics and philosophy**
- Clarify **grading and late policies**

### AI Tool Policy Considerations:
- Students generally support **limited, educational use**
- Clear guidelines needed on **appropriate vs. inappropriate use**
- Emphasis on **learning enhancement rather than replacement**

## Summary

Students show high enthusiasm for the course with realistic expectations about workload. The majority are moderately confident in C++ and eager for hands-on, project-based learning. There's strong interest in practical AI applications like pathfinding and procedural generation, with thoughtful perspectives on AI tool usage that favor learning enhancement over dependency.

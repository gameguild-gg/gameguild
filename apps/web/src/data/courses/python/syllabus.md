# Python Programming

Students will learn the history and basics of computing as well as the fundamentals of Python programming. General
topics include: the history of computing, number systems, Boolean logic, algorithm design and implementation, and modern
computer organization. Programming topics include: memory and variables, data types, mathematical operations, basic file
I/O, decision-making, repetitions, functions, and list
basics. [Source](https://classlist.champlain.edu/show/course/number/CSI_160)

Upot completion of the Python Programming course, students should be able to:

### Objective Outcomes

- **Identify** the historical milestones in computing and describe the basic organization of computer systems.
- **Recall** and **explain** the different characteristics of data types and data structures in Python.
- **Explain** the role of coding standards in software development and why adhering to them is important.
- **Describe** the significance of accessibility in programming and how it impacts users.
- **Demonstrate** the ability to manipulate files using basic input and output operations in Python.
- **Apply** the concepts of number systems by converting values between binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and other formats.
- **Compare** and evaluate various conditional constructs to determine the most appropriate for solving specific
  programming problems.
- **Analyze** different iteration constructs and select the one that best suits a given programming scenario.
- **Assess** the correctness and efficiency of programs by designing, implementing, testing, and debugging them to meet
  specified requirements.
- **Develop** modular programs using the principles of structured (functional) decomposition to break down complex
  problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Design** and **implement** algorithms to solve problems using the Python programming language.

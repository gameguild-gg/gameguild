# Expectatiotns for DSA Class

## Executive Summary

This document synthesizes feedback from 36 students enrolled in the Data Structures and Algorithms course. The analysis reveals students who are eager to learn practical applications, moderately confident in C++ but needing refreshers, and thoughtful about AI tool usage in education. Key themes include preference for hands-on learning, concerns about workload balance, and strong interest in game development applications.

## Key Findings

### 1. Class Expectations & Learning Goals

**High Enthusiasm for Practical Applications:**

- Students are particularly excited about learning sorting algorithms and their real-world applications
- Strong interest in game development applications (pathfinding, AI, optimization)
- Desire to understand when and why to use specific algorithms and data structures

**Representative Quotes:**

- "I would like to learn how to write algorithms for games. for example npc pathfinding and things like that."
- "I am excited to see how algorithms and sorts are used in real world context. i.e. I know that a sort can produce an ordered data set, but how is this applied to solve bigger challenges."
- "I am excited to actually learn some more complex algorithms, as I usually end up overthinking what is needed for some data based assignments and make an abomination of an algorithm."

### 2. Preferred Class Structure & Workload

**Hands-On Learning Preference:**

- Strong preference for practical implementation over pure theory
- Students want to code algorithms themselves rather than just study them
- Desire for guided practice followed by independent work

**Workload Expectations:**

- Preference for 1-2 assignments per week
- Balance between learning and manageable workload
- Some students prefer fewer, more complex long-term assignments

**Representative Quotes:**

- "I think coding assignments should be the majority of the work, since it would help me get a lot of practice in and be better at remembering the algorithms we use."
- "I guess an ideal algorithms class like this would have a lot of self implementation assignments so that we don't get lost in the theory of structures and what's best, but instead are able to see and realize why things are better for certain tasks."
- "I think there should be a lot of hands-on work with them as that is how I personally learn best, by doing rather than reading about it."

### 3. C++ Confidence Levels

**Moderate Confidence with Need for Refresher:**

- Most students feel "fairly confident" or "somewhat confident" in C++
- Common concern about being "rusty" after summer break
- Several students mention specific weak areas (linked lists, classes, multi-file projects)

**Confidence Distribution:**

- High Confidence: ~25% of students
- Moderate Confidence: ~60% of students  
- Low Confidence: ~15% of students

**Representative Quotes:**

- "I am fairly confident in my C++ skills when it comes to what we have already been taught through intro and advanced programming."
- "I am unfortunately not very confident in C++. I took intro and advanced, and advanced was very hard for me."
- "I'm pretty confident in my c++ skills because i spent an entire year learning it"

### 4. Understanding of Data Structures & Algorithms

**Varied Understanding Levels:**

- Basic understanding: organizing, storing, and sorting data
- Recognition of optimization and efficiency benefits
- Some students acknowledge limited current knowledge
- Strong interest in learning practical applications

**Key Concepts Mentioned:**

- Data organization and storage
- Optimization and efficiency
- Problem-solving tools
- Game development applications

**Representative Quotes:**

- "Data structures and algorithms are ways of searching for data or organizing data to be utilized in a more optimized way later."
- "To me, data structures are was to store and organize data, and algorithms are methods for processing data with a specific goal in mind (sorting, finding a min or max, identifying trends, etc.)"
- "Data structures and algorithms, to me, are ways of containing, labeling, and processing data so that it can be utilized in a useful capacity."

### 5. AI Assistant Tools Perspectives

**Thoughtful and Cautious Approach:**

- General consensus: AI should be a tool, not a replacement
- Preference for using AI for learning and understanding, not code generation
- Concerns about over-reliance hindering learning
- Some students completely avoid AI tools

**Usage Patterns:**

- **Acceptable Uses:** Explaining concepts, debugging help, learning assistance
- **Unacceptable Uses:** Complete code generation, doing assignments
- **Concerns:** Accuracy, learning hindrance, job market impact

**Representative Quotes:**

- "I think AI assistants are a little threatening to the job market, but can be useful as a tool, not a replacement."
- "I refuse to use AI to complete assignments purely out of spite for all the people I have known, either personally or through stories, who use AI in stupid ways."
- "I think that AI should only be used to learn the content if you are struggling. I don't think it should, or is even reliable enough, to code."

### 6. Schedule & Course Structure Feedback

**General Satisfaction:**

- Most students approve of the current weekly schedule
- Few specific change requests
- Some concerns about assignment due dates on non-class days
- Preference for assignments due during class days

**Specific Feedback:**

- "I have already noticed that for this class and several others, I have assignments due on random days we don't have class (such as Saturday night), and I find that a little annoying."

## Student Profiles & Concerns

### High Achievers

- Confident in C++, excited about advanced topics
- Want challenging, complex assignments
- Interested in optimization and efficiency

### Struggling Students

- Lower C++ confidence, need more support
- Prefer structured learning with clear examples
- Concerned about workload balance

### Game Development Focus

- Strong interest in game-specific applications
- Want to learn pathfinding, AI algorithms
- Motivated by practical game development needs

## Recommendations

### 1. Course Structure

- **Maintain hands-on approach** with practical implementation assignments
- **Provide C++ refresher materials** early in the semester
- **Include game development examples** to maintain engagement
- **Balance theory with practice** - brief theory followed by implementation

### 2. Assignment Design

- **1-2 assignments per week** with varying complexity
- **Progressive difficulty** starting with simpler concepts
- **Real-world applications** especially game development scenarios
- **Clear rubrics** for students with varying confidence levels

### 3. AI Tool Guidelines

- **Establish clear policies** on acceptable AI usage
- **Encourage AI for learning** (explanations, concept clarification)
- **Discourage AI for code generation** in assignments
- **Provide examples** of appropriate vs. inappropriate AI usage

### 4. Support Strategies

- **Early C++ review sessions** for students needing refreshers
- **Office hours emphasis** for students with lower confidence
- **Peer collaboration opportunities** for learning support
- **Multiple explanation methods** for different learning styles

### 5. Schedule Considerations

- **Keep current weekly structure** - generally well-received
- **Consider assignment due dates** - prefer class days over weekends
- **Flexible pacing** for complex topics that may need extra time

## Conclusion

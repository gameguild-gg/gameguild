# Data Structures and Algorithms

Students compare and contrast a variety of data structures. Students compare algorithms for tasks such as searching and sorting, while articulating efficiency in terms of time complexity. Students implement data structures and algorithms to support solution designs. [Course Catalog](https://classlist.champlain.edu/show/course/number/CSI_281)

Upon completion of the Data Structures and Algorithms course in C++, students should be able to:

### Objective Outcomes

- **Analyze** and contrast diverse data structures
- **Evaluate** algorithmic efficiency using time complexity analysis
- **Implement**, **create** and **apply** data structures and algorithms
- Critically **assess** sorting algorithms
- **Analyze** and contrast search algorithms

### Assessment Outcomes

- **Demonstrate** the ability to evaluate and differentiate between various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, based on their characteristics and use cases.
- **Evaluate** algorithms by analyzing their time complexity, enabling the comparison of different algorithms and making informed decisions about their suitability for specific problem-solving scenarios.
- **Develop** and implement solutions using appropriate data structures and algorithms to address real-world problems, demonstrating proficiency in translating solution designs into C++ code.
- **Investigate** and compare the merits and drawbacks of brute-force and divide-and-conquer sorting algorithms, including quicksort, mergesort, and insertion sort, in order to make informed choices when selecting sorting techniques for specific scenarios.
- **Examine** and compare the characteristics, advantages, and limitations of sequential, binary, depth-first, and breadth-first search algorithms, demonstrating the ability to choose the most suitable search strategy based on problem requirements.

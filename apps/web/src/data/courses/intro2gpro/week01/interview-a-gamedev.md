Your task is to **interview a Game Programmer** or **Game Developer**.

You can interview a **professional** game developer, a **hobbyist**, an **Alumni**, or a **student game developer**. Hint: Kindly ask the interviewee if you can record to focus on the questions and interactions or take notes during the interview.

Ask about their experiences, work, and advice for new game developers, and add at least three other relevant questions by your choice. Don't ask professors, teachers, or instructors.

- You could reach professional or hobbyist game developers on Discord, LinkedIn, Twitter, or other social media;
- You can also reach out to Alumni, check the Game Studio Senior Showcase, and search for their LinkedIn profiles;
- If you can't find anyone, you can interview a student game developer (seniors preferred), but you should try first to find a professional or hobbyist game developer.

We will discuss this topic in class next week. Please get ready to speak about your findings! No need for presentations, it would be a casual talk.

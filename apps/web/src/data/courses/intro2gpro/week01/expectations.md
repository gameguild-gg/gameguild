# Expectations for Intro Game Programming Class

## Key Findings

### 1. Class Expectations & Learning Goals

**High Enthusiasm for Practical Game Development:**

- Students are excited to learn how games work "behind the scenes"
- Strong interest in learning various game engines (Unity, Unreal Engine) and programming languages
- Desire to understand industry practices, collaboration methods, and the game development pipeline
- Interest in bringing creative ideas to life through programming
- Learning about different roles in game programming and detailed systems (procedural generation, machine learning)

**Representative Quotes:**

- "I am very excited to learn more about the different roles of game programmers in the industry and apply that knowledge in the - final project."
- "Game programming for me is the ability to make an idea come to life for other people to enjoy."
- "I would like to see how the game industry works so I can be ready when I go in."
- "I would like to see/learn more about how to collaborate with others more easily on projects, specifically with unity"
- "I am hoping to see detailed systems that are used in game development: procedural generation, machine learning, etc."

### 2. Preferred Class Structure & Learning Approach

**Strong Preference for Hands-On Learning:**

- Students want practical assignments over theoretical lectures
- Preference for project-based learning with creative freedom
- Desire for collaborative learning environments
- Balance between guided instruction and independent exploration
- Gradual progression from basics to advanced concepts

**Workload Expectations:**

- Preference for manageable but meaningful assignments
- Students want challenging work that builds skills progressively
- Some concern about being overwhelmed, especially among beginners
- Reasonable workload that doesn't overwhelm students

**Representative Quotes:**

- "I think that grading should be based on effort, rather than the product that might come out because some of us may not have as much experience as someone else in the class."
- "I think ideally the work for this class should take the form of learning through practice and providing information on how it was done."
- "I really want practical applications, making code instead of just learning about it, I love conversations and being able to ask questions without the associated stigma."
- "I think an ideal Intro Game Programming class should cover the basics of coding and coding concepts, with many hands-on projects, without overloading students with assignments that they can't complete on time"
- "I think that an ideal game programming class would be primarily about improving your skill in making games, and give freedom in how you go about making the games"

### 3. Coding Confidence Levels

**Wide Range of Experience:**

- **High Confidence (6 students, ~20%):** Students with significant prior experience
- **Moderate Confidence (12 students, ~40%):** Some experience in various languages, moderately confident
- **Low/No Confidence (11 students, ~40%):** Beginners or those with minimal experience

**High Confidence Examples:**

- "I am very confident in coding, I have been learning to since 6th grade"
- "I'm pretty confident in my coding abilities, as I have been programing games since I was in 3rd grade"
- "High schools data structures has given me some incredible confidence in my coding capabilities"

**Moderate Confidence Examples:**

- "id say around a 6 out of 10. I've programmed before and I learn and problem solve easily, however I'm no developer"
- "I have some experience in multiple object-oriented and non-object-oriented languages, but I am a bit rusty in them"
- "I am confident In my ability to code, though I have a tough time remembering the syntax"

**Low Confidence Examples:**

- "No experience, so I'm pretty scared of starting with no skill and being left behind"
- "I personally am not very confident in my coding capabilities, I have barely touched code"
- "My last coding class was in 2009 and I haven't done anything since, so I am not at all confident in my abilities"

**Common Concerns Among Beginners:**

- Fear of being left behind
- Anxiety about syntax and technical details
- Need for supportive learning environment

### 4. Understanding of Game Programming

**Common Themes:**

- **Creative Expression:** Bringing ideas to life and sharing them with others, artistic outlet
- **Technical Foundation:** The backend/heart of games that makes everything function
- **Collaborative Process:** Working with teams to create cohesive experiences
- **Problem-Solving:** Making ideas work efficiently and smoothly, creating interactive experiences
- **Industry Preparation:** Learning professional game development skills

**Key Concepts Mentioned:**

- Backend functionality that players don't see
- Connecting game components into cohesive experiences
- Industry collaboration and teamwork
- Creative and technical problem-solving

**Representative Quotes:**

- "For me, Game Programming is a way to bring my ideas to life, and to share those ideas with other people"
- "The ability to make an idea come to life for other people to enjoy"
- "a way to connect pieces of a game into one cohesive project, as well as an opportunity to work with like-minded people"
- "Game programming for me is taking an idea and making it work in the smoothest most efficient way possible"
- "A way to pursue my passion for this subject, I love the creation of games and wish to create something notable in the gaming space"
- "Game programming for me is the backend/heart of a game that most gamers or the target audience who play games don't think about or really care for."
- "Game programming is a very complicated form of creative expression with the intent of making an experience instead of an artwork."

### 5. AI Assistant Tools Perspectives

**Cautious but Pragmatic Approach:**

Most students express a balanced view of AI tools, supporting their use for learning and assistance while warning against over-reliance. General consensus: AI should assist learning, not replace it.

**Learning Tool Support:**

- "I think they can be helpful for learning, however I don't think it should be used unrestricted in actual projects"
- "I think AI is an amazing tool to use for learning how to code, it is amazing in taking concepts and making them easier to understand"
- "I think that AI tools should only be used to help people who already have a strong foundation in coding"

**Concerns About Over-reliance:**

- "I think AI should be mostly left out of coding, and that you should not use AI to try and code anything that you wouldn't otherwise be able to code"
- "I stay as far away from all forms of generative AI as I can, I think overuse can cause you to rely on it"
- "AI should be used as a tool not a crutch. That is, being overly reliant on AI in general will make one LESS capable of their own work"

**Practical Applications:**

- "using AI to explain concepts or break down coding syntax or having AI to help point out possible errors in your code and explain why it is a problem is beneficial"
- "Helpful, good for finding bugs, seeing what is executing and when"
- "I think AI tools are ok when used to assist with syntax, but nothing more complicated than that"

**Acceptable Uses:**
- Learning and understanding concepts
- Debugging and error identification
- Syntax assistance
- Code explanation

**Unacceptable Uses:**
- Complete code generation for assignments
- Replacing personal learning and problem-solving
- Creating code without understanding

### 6. Schedule & Course Structure Feedback

**Overall Satisfaction:**

The vast majority of students (26 out of 29) expressed satisfaction with the proposed weekly schedule, with only minor suggestions for improvement.

**Positive Responses:**

- "I don't currently see any real problems with the weekly schedule plan"
- "I don't think so!!"
- "Seems pretty good"
- "The schedule seems properly balanced. I think that having six weeks to finish the final project is a reasonable amount of time"
- "I think the weekly plan looks great, I don't have any suggestions for it."

**Specific Concerns:**

- "it would be nice if it were more clear when assignments were due"
- "I'd prefer to not do the developer interview"
- "I am pretty socially awkward and the interview of someone else I something I will struggle with"

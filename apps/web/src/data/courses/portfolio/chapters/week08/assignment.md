## **Communicating Through Visuals** - Peer Review Assignment:

### **Objective**
In this assignment, you will create **visual assets** (screenshots, GIFs, or videos) for your personal projects, capstone, and/or portfolio. The goal is to **showcase different aspects of your work and skills** in a way that effectively communicates your intended message.

### **Your Task**

1. **Create at Least Two Visual Assets**
    - **A featured project card**: This should act as a **thumbnail or preview** to grab attention for a project.
    - **A feature explanation**: A visual that clearly explains an important feature of your project.

::: note
Your deliverables are GIF, video, diagram or annotated screenshot
:::

2. **Describe Your Intent**
    - Along with each visual, write a short explanation of **what you want it to communicate**.
    - Example: *“This GIF is meant to highlight the dynamic lighting system in my game and how it interacts with player movement.”*

3. **Post Your Submission**
    - Upload your visuals to the forum. You can embed them directly or provide links (YouTube, Imgur, google drive etc.).
    - Include your description for each visual.

### **Peer Review Guidelines**

1. **Review at Least Three Other Students' Submissions**
    - Prioritize those with fewer responses.

2. **Provide Meaningful Feedback**
    - Does the visual effectively communicate the intended message?
    - Is the framing, lighting, or timing appropriate?
    - If it’s a GIF or video, is it the right length and format for the intended purpose?
    - How could the clarity or impact be improved?

3. **Engage in Discussion**
    - Respond to feedback on your own work and discuss possible refinements.

### **Why This Matters**

- High-quality visuals are **critical for portfolios, resumes, and job applications**.
- Learning to craft visuals that **communicate clearly** will help you stand out.
- Giving and receiving feedback will **help you refine your own approach**.

**Deadline:** Ensure your post and feedback are submitted before the deadline.

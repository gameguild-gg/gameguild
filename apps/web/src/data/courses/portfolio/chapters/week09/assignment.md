# **Peer Review Forum: Near-Final Demo Reel Feedback**

## **Assignment Overview**

This is your **last chance for feedback** before finalizing your demo reel! Share your **near-final version** and receive **peer critiques** to refine pacing, transitions, and clarity before submission.

### **What You Need to Do:**

1. **Post your near-final demo reel.**
    - This should be a **polished** version, incorporating **previous feedback** where possible.
    - Focus on **pacing, transitions, and clarity**, using **design principles** (contrast, balance, rhythm, etc.).

2. **Write a short text** describing **specific issues or concerns** you want feedback on.
    - Example: *"I‚Äôm worried that my transitions feel too abrupt. Do they help maintain flow, or do they break immersion?"*
    - Example: *"Is my reel communicating the complexity of my game‚Äôs AI properly? Should I slow down any parts?"*

3. **Give feedback to at least 3 classmates.**
    - **Prioritize classmates with fewer comments.**
    - Ensure feedback is **constructive and specific** (e.g., suggest **how to improve pacing or transitions**, not just ‚Äúit‚Äôs good‚Äù).
    - Evaluate if the **message is clearly communicated** as intended by the creator.

## **Grading (10 Points Total)**

- **6 Points** - Submit your **near-final** demo reel with clear pacing, transitions, and clarity.

## **Peer Feedback Guidelines**
- **Is the pacing engaging, or does it feel rushed/too slow?**  
- **Are the transitions smooth and natural?**  
- **Is the message clear, or do certain parts need more emphasis?**  
- **Does it follow design principles (contrast, balance, rhythm, hierarchy, etc.)?**  
- **Does the demo reel leave a lasting impression?**

### **Example of a Great Feedback Comment:**
‚úÖ *"Your transitions are mostly smooth, but the cut at 0:15 feels a bit abrupt. Maybe add a slight fade or time it with the music beat?"*

‚ùå *"Looks good!"* (This is not helpful‚Äîbe specific!)

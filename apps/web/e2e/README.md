# E2E Test Suite for Game Guild - Slug-based Navigation

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive E2E test suite created for the Game Guild application, specifically focusing on slug-based course navigation and API integration.

## Test Structure

### 1. API Tests (`/e2e/api/`)

#### Enhanced Program Slug Tests (`enhanced-program-slug.spec.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Comprehensive API testing for slug-based program endpoints
- **Coverage**:
  - âœ… Public API endpoint validation (`/api/program/published`)
  - âœ… Slug format validation (URL-safe, lowercase, hyphens only)
  - âœ… Individual program slug endpoint testing (`/api/program/slug/{slug}`)
  - âœ… Error handling for invalid slugs (404/401 responses)
  - âœ… Data consistency between endpoints
  - âœ… Concurrent request handling
  - âœ… Response time validation
  - âœ… Program structure validation (categories, difficulties, types)

#### Simple API Tests (`simple-api-test.spec.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Basic smoke tests for API functionality
- **Coverage**:
  - âœ… Published programs endpoint
  - âœ… Program by slug endpoint
  - âœ… Invalid slug handling

#### Shell Scripts

- **`test-api.sh`**: Basic bash script for testing API endpoints
- **`comprehensive-test.sh`**: Full bash script testing both API and web integration

### 2. Integration Tests (`/e2e/integration/`)

#### Course Catalog Integration (`course-catalog.spec.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Test web application integration with slug-based navigation
- **Coverage**:
  - âœ… Course catalog display with slug-based URLs
  - âœ… Navigation to course details using slugs
  - âœ… Course filtering with maintained slug navigation
  - âœ… API integration and data display
  - âœ… 404 handling for invalid course slugs
  - âœ… Data consistency between catalog and detail views
  - âœ… Loading states and error handling
  - âœ… Empty state handling with mocked responses

### 3. Test Utilities (`/e2e/utils/`)

#### API Helper (`api-helper.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Reusable utilities for API testing
- **Features**:
  - âœ… Program fetching methods
  - âœ… Authentication helpers
  - âœ… Slug validation utilities
  - âœ… Program structure validation
  - âœ… Mock data for testing

## Test Results Summary

### API Tests Status

```
ðŸš€ API E2E Test Results:
âœ… API slug endpoints working correctly
âœ… Error handling implemented properly
âœ… Response structure contains required fields
âœ… Slug format validation (URL-safe: ^[a-z0-9-]+$)
âœ… Authentication handling (401 for protected endpoints)
âœ… Public endpoints accessible (200 for /api/program/published)
```

### Key Findings

1. **Public Endpoints**: `/api/program/published` is publicly accessible and returns well-formatted data
2. **Protected Endpoints**: Individual program slug endpoints require authentication (HTTP 401)
3. **Slug Format**: All program slugs follow proper URL-safe format
4. **Error Handling**: Invalid slugs properly return 404 or 401 responses
5. **Data Consistency**: Program data structure is consistent across endpoints

## Slug-based Navigation Implementation

### Frontend Components Updated

- âœ… `CourseGrid` - Uses slugs for course card links
- âœ… `CourseAccessCard` - Slug-based navigation and enrollment
- âœ… `CourseSidebar` - Slug-based course references
- âœ… Loading components - Proper data-testid attributes

### Backend API Endpoints

- âœ… `GET /api/program/published` - Returns programs with slugs
- âœ… `GET /api/program/slug/{slug}` - Fetch program by slug
- âœ… Proper HTTP status codes (200, 401, 404)

### URL Structure

- **Catalog**: `/courses`
- **Course Detail**: `/course/{slug}` (e.g., `/course/unity-3d-game-development`)
- **Enrollment**: Uses slug-based program lookup

## Test Execution

### Running API Tests

```bash
# Enhanced API tests
npx playwright test e2e/api/enhanced-program-slug.spec.ts --config playwright-api.config.ts

# Simple API tests
npx playwright test e2e/api/simple-api-test.spec.ts --config playwright-api.config.ts

# Shell script tests
bash e2e/comprehensive-test.sh
```

### Running Integration Tests

```bash
# Full Playwright test suite
npx playwright test

# Integration tests only
npx playwright test e2e/integration/
```

### Prerequisites

1. **API Server**: Must be running on `http://localhost:5001`
2. **Web Server**: Must be running on `http://localhost:3000` (for integration tests)
3. **Dependencies**: Playwright installed (`npm install @playwright/test`)

## Configuration

### Playwright Configurations

- **`playwright.config.ts`**: Full configuration with web servers
- **`playwright-api.config.ts`**: API-only configuration (no web server dependency)

### Test Data

- Uses real API data from `/api/program/published`
- Fallback to known slugs for testing
- Mock data for empty state testing

## Coverage Areas

### âœ… Completed

- [x] API slug endpoint testing
- [x] Error handling validation
- [x] Slug format validation
- [x] Data structure validation
- [x] Authentication handling
- [x] Web integration basic tests
- [x] Loading state tests
- [x] Empty state handling

### ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Full enrollment flow E2E tests
- [ ] Payment integration tests
- [ ] User authentication flow tests
- [ ] Advanced filtering and search tests
- [ ] Performance testing under load
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility tests

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types in test files
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and edge cases
3. **Test Isolation**: Each test is independent and can run separately
4. **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation of API responses
5. **Performance**: Response time validation and concurrent request testing
6. **Maintainability**: Reusable utilities and clear test structure
7. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of test coverage

## Conclusion

The E2E test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the slug-based navigation system, ensuring that:

- API endpoints correctly handle slug-based requests
- Frontend components properly integrate with slug-based URLs
- Error states are handled gracefully
- Performance requirements are met
- Data consistency is maintained across the application

The test suite is ready for CI/CD integration and provides a solid foundation for continued development and testing of the Game Guild application.
